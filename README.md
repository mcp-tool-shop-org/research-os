# research-os

Local-first CLI that turns an open-ended topic into a gated **research-pack** — a structured repo where Claude, Cowork, or a swarm can work for hours without hallucinating or flattening the investigation.

## What it is

`research-os` is the control plane between "I want to research X" and a frozen, claim-traceable evidence base. It separates discovery leads from fetch evidence, raw extraction from triaged claims, contradiction detection from contradiction resolution, and review decisions from synthesis dispositions. Every step writes to an append-only ledger; every readiness verdict is computed from those ledgers, not asserted.

It is not a report generator. It is not an LLM-orchestration framework. It does not write your synthesis for you. It enforces the conditions under which synthesis can begin.

**v0.1 has been used exactly once: by itself, on itself.** That single use found seven correctness gaps in `research-os`, each fixed before this release. The proof trail — seven sessions, two integration patterns earned, 463 vitest cases, one frozen pack — lives in [`docs/dogfood-proof.md`](docs/dogfood-proof.md). Live handbook: <https://mcp-tool-shop-org.github.io/research-os/handbook/>.

## The 16 load-bearing laws

| # | Law |
|---|-----|
| 1 | No synthesis before source truth. |
| 2 | Fetch is evidence; extraction is interpretation. |
| 3 | Models may interpret source spans; they may not author evidence spans. |
| 4 | Extraction may overproduce; synthesis may not inherit abundance. |
| 5 | Contradiction mapping surfaces tension; it does not resolve, synthesize, or decide which claim wins. |
| 6 | Gates decide whether a section is eligible for synthesis. They do not synthesize or hide failure. |
| 7 | Adversarial review judges research integrity. It does not synthesize or rewrite source truth. |
| 8 | Indexing makes research truth queryable. It does not create new truth or become the source of record. |
| 9 | Cowork handoff renders operational instructions from research truth. It does not create truth or bypass gates. |
| 10 | Synthesis workspace organizes accepted research truth for Cowork. It does not create synthesis or bypass handoff mode. |
| 11 | Pack audit aggregates existing research truth. It does not create new truth or hide section-level evidence. |
| 12 | Discovery proposes leads; only fetch produces evidence. |
| 13 | A reviewer is not trusted until seeded failures prove recall. |
| 14 | Claim abundance is not research quality. Claims must be triaged before they can compete for synthesis. |
| 15 | Freeze locks completed research truth. It does not complete unfinished research or convert repair state into evidence. |
| 16 | Waivers relax source constraints; they cannot manufacture evidence. |

**Law 3** — the LLM never authors evidence text. research-os builds a deterministic excerpt ledger (stable IDs like `ex_<source_id_hex>_001`); the LLM picks excerpt IDs; research-os copies the literal text. The "paraphrase-as-quote" failure class is structurally impossible.

**Law 14** — between extraction and review, `research-os claim triage` deduplicates, caps per-source contribution, and parks low-leverage candidates. Triage does NOT mutate `claims.jsonl`; parked claims remain on the canonical ledger.

## The v0.1 workflow chain

```
discover
→ gather
→ claim extract
→ claim audit-density
→ claim triage
→ contradict map
→ contradict resolve
→ review
→ review-promote
→ gate
→ section report
→ audit
→ index build
→ cowork handoff
→ synth workspace
→ freeze
```

Each step is a CLI command. Each step writes to append-only artifacts. No step synthesizes, resolves, or creates new truth — those invariants are enforced, not trusted. Review accepts/rejects/requests-repair on candidate claims; gate consumes those review decisions to compute `synthesis_eligible`; freeze is the final integrity lock that refuses to mark a pack done unless every layer agrees. See [docs/dogfood-proof.md](docs/dogfood-proof.md) for the v0.1 proof that the chain holds end-to-end.

This is the structural alternative to *search → summarize → pretty report*. The chain is the product.

## Install

**Requirements:** Node.js ≥ 20.

```bash
# From source (v0.1.0 is not yet published to npm)
git clone https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/research-os.git
cd research-os
npm install
npm run build
npm link   # makes `research-os` available on your PATH
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Create a new research-pack
research-os init "How should X be structured?"

# Add a section
research-os section add 01-landscape --purpose "Map the current landscape"

# Discover and approve sources, then gather
research-os discover run 01-landscape
research-os discover approve 01-landscape --top 8
research-os gather 01-landscape --approved

# Run the per-section chain
research-os claim extract 01-landscape
research-os claim audit-density 01-landscape
research-os claim triage 01-landscape
research-os contradict map 01-landscape --triaged-only
research-os review 01-landscape --triaged-only --preset hermes-two-pass --profile hermes-two-pass
research-os review-promote 01-landscape --profile hermes-two-pass
research-os gate 01-landscape
research-os section report 01-landscape

# Pack-level finish
research-os audit
research-os index build --all
research-os cowork handoff
research-os synth workspace   # only if handoff returned synthesis_ready
research-os freeze
```

**For a real worked example**, see the dogfood pack at `research-os-packs/research-os-spec/` — every artifact, every receipt, every disposition, every freeze fingerprint, all on disk in append-only ledgers. That pack is what produced `docs/dogfood-proof.md`.

**Requires [ollama-intern-mcp](https://github.com/mcp-tool-shop-org/ollama-intern-mcp) running locally** for LLM extraction, triage, review, and discovery. Default model is `hermes3:8b`; override with `OLLAMA_INTERN_MODEL=<model>`. Set `OLLAMA_HOST` if Ollama is not on the default `localhost:11434`.

## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `research-os` | The control plane / CLI / gates / orchestration law (this repo) |
| `research-pack` | The generated repo artifact for one research effort |
| `research section` | A bounded unit of investigation inside a pack |
| `research receipt` | Proof a section passed source/claim/gate checks |

## Security

`research-os` is a local-first CLI. It reads and writes files within the research-pack directory you point it at, and (when using `gather`) issues outbound HTTP requests to fetch source URLs you provide. It does not: run a server, accept inbound connections, store credentials, or send telemetry. No secrets are written to pack artifacts. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the vulnerability reporting policy.

## Status

**v0.1.0** — frozen 2026-05-08. The dogfood pack at `research-os-packs/research-os-spec/` (sibling repo) reached freeze with 296 accepted claims across 8 sections, 17 dispositioned, 30 operator-overridden, 0 active repair blockers, 0 unresolved contradictions, all gates `synthesis_eligible=true`. 463/463 vitest passing. Sixteen load-bearing laws cumulative. See [`docs/dogfood-proof.md`](docs/dogfood-proof.md) for the seven findings and the freeze receipt fingerprints.

### What v0.1 is not

- Not battle-tested by external users. The single dogfood run found seven bugs.
- Not yet on npm. Install from source until `npm publish` happens.
- Not a synthesis writer. The `synth workspace` command generates the structured workspace; humans (or Cowork) write the prose against accepted claim IDs.
- Not API-stable under semver. v1.0.0 is an earned state, not a calendar date — see [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the five experiments that close the gap.

### Known limitations

- **Extractor provenance is not visible at the gate seam.** A section can pass the accepted-claim floor while relying on heuristic-fallback claims when the calibrated extractor (Ollama with the configured model) is unavailable. Recorded as a known weakness; future hardening will report accepted claims by extractor and require the floor's worth of accepted claims from the calibrated path.
- **Reviewer model selection beyond the calibrated `hermes-two-pass` baseline is unresolved.** The dogfood arc validated one reviewer config; alternative models need their own seeded-failure recall calibration before they can be trusted.
- **The dogfood pack used `mistral-nemo:12b` for extraction (canonical default is `hermes3:8b`).** Discovery hallucinated wrong-domain results for self-referential section names — corrected by query-precision discipline (see handbook) and operator-pre-staged URLs for ambiguous topics.

## Roadmap to v1.0

v1.0 is an earned state, not a release date. Five open experiments stand between v0.1 and v1.0 — API stability under external pressure, a non-self-referential dogfood pack, closing the extractor-provenance gap, generalizing reviewer calibration beyond `hermes-two-pass`, and a clean baseline run on `hermes3:8b`. Full plan in [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md). The architecture lock holds throughout; v1.0 deepens what v0.1 proved rather than reopening it.
